# Final Project

## Data Source
* My data is the volatility of Bitcoin, S&P 500 index, EUR/USD, and gold calculated by the weekly-average prices, and the price of Bitcoin. The source of the prices is investing.com. For example, the historical prices of Bitcoin are from: https://www.investing.com/crypto/bitcoin/btc-usd-historical-data
* Volatility is a measurement of the risk of an asset. It is calculated as the standard deviation. I want to compare the volatility of Bitcoin with other 3 assets in addition to the weekly-averaged prices of Bitcoin to show the high risk of it. The prices of Bitcoin will serve as a background (in line chart with colored fill\ rigion) to give audience an intuitive feeling of the risk.  The volatility of all 4 assets will be shown in line chart.

## Method and Medium
* I will use shorthand to complete my final project
* In the front of the presentation, I will give a very brief introduction to Bitcoin about what it is and its historical prices.
* In the data analysis part, I will give a brief introduction to volatility, stating that it is simply a measure of risk. Then I will show the chart, and talk about the main idea of it. 
* Finally, I will give the call to reaction: Get to know Bitcoin better than other investors or do not invest in it.
