# Final Project Part I

## Data Source
* My data is the volatility of Bitcoin, S&P 500 index, EUR/USD, and gold calculated by the weekly-average prices, and the price of Bitcoin. The source of the prices is investing.com. For example, the historical prices of Bitcoin are from: https://www.investing.com/crypto/bitcoin/btc-usd-historical-data
* Volatility is a measurement of the risk of an asset. It is calculated as the standard deviation. I want to compare the volatility of Bitcoin with other 3 assets in addition to the weekly-averaged prices of Bitcoin to show the high risk of it. The prices of Bitcoin will serve as a background (in line chart with colored fill\ rigion) to give audience an intuitive feeling of the risk.  The volatility of all 4 assets will be shown in line chart. 
* Link to the data: https://github.com/yuyanc6/yuyanc-portfolio/blob/master/all_volatility_bitPrice.xlsx

## Method and Medium
* I will use shorthand to complete my final project
* In the front of the presentation, I will give a very brief introduction to Bitcoin about what it is and its historical prices.
* In the data analysis part, I will give a brief introduction to volatility, stating that it is simply a measure of risk. Then I will show the chart, and talk about the main idea of it. 
* Finally, I will give the call to reaction: Get to know Bitcoin better than other investors or do not invest in it.

## User research

* the target audience you hope to reach with your story;  
Normal investors who at least heard about Bitcoin  
  
* your approach to identifying representative individuals to interview;  
Representative individuals include my classmates, who knew something or heard about Bitcoin before but not familiar with it. Also, they want to invest in some asset in order to keep their money from depreciation.  
I presented to them my storyboard and sketches as I would in my final presentation. Here are the feedbacks from them. The answers given by them are listed under the corresponding question.  
  
* your interview script;  
Questions are modified from the Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile:  
1.	Do you get the point I tried to make?  
a)	Yes.  
b)	Yes.  
c)	Combined with the title and the volatility chart, your point is made.  
2.	All basic aspects covered?  
a)	Do not Know. Maybe.  
b)	Yes.  
c)	If volatility reveals risks well, then yes.  
3.	Is the presentation logical?  
a)	Yes.  
b)	There should be more description in presentation to transit from the price part to volatility part.  
c)	Yes  
4.	Do you understand the chart?  
a)	Yes.  
b)	No for the first sight.  
c)	Do not understand the hack part, how does it relate to risk?  
5.	Easy to understand the chart?  
a)	No, texts should be made more obvious. Volatility chart is difficult to understand because what is represented by each line is hard to be told.  
b)	Easy if there are more marks on the line for the second chart.  
c)	Volatility chart is easy but hack chart is not  
6.	Do the charts look good?  
a)	No.  
b)	Chart should be decorated more.  
c)	Yes  
7.	Do you know more about the risk of Bitcoin now?  
a)	Yes for risk of hacks, No for price risk.  
b)	Yes, overall Bitcoin is dangerous.  
c)	Yes, risk of price is high.  
  
* the findings from your interviews;  
  * Further modifications need to be made on the volatility chart to make it easier to understand. Emphasize on the volatility line of Bitcoin.
  * Typography of text needs to be more contrasting.
  * Charts needs to be refined
  * Information should be talked that cannot be described in charts or website but is important to make the presentation logical
  
* changes you implemented to your sketches, storyboards and wireframes to address the issues identified.
  * Change the price chart from line chart to bar chart. The color of the chart is changed to orange – the theme color of Bitcoin. Key information about Bitcoin is added on the chart.
  * Change the font size of the text. Change the color of each line (for example use green for dollar line and yellow for gold line). Add a small Bitcoin icon for the Bitcoin line to differentiate it from other line. Add the area chart of price and make it opaque (serve as the background and help audience transfer from the price chart in the former part to the volatility chart in this part).
  * Change the title from “Bitcoin Hacks” to “Bitcoin Stolen in Exchange Hacks”. Increase the overall size of circles.
